## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows (recommended), Linux, or macOS
- For Linux/WSL: `xclip` package (for clipboard functionality)

### Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install pyperclip ttkbootstrap
```

### On Linux/WSL Only
```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThiagoMaria-SecurityIT/unified-command-tool
   cd unified-command-tool
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (I recommend using Python's built-in venv):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   (or `python3 -m venv venv` if you have multiple Python versions)

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - If none of the above worked, try a mix of both (if you are using Git Bash in Windows for example)
     ```bash
     source venv/Scripts/activate
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python unified_command_tool.py
   ```
